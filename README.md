//Regarding the 3d models, each added model should maintain the naming style, like for example if new model sheet say a8 is introduced, then the naming should be like this -> a8vertr8.glb a8landsr8.glb a8vertlf8.glb and a8landslf8.glb. As for the new models , use blender 4.2, upload any right existing model, and make sure to align the new sheet correctly with the exiting right sheets, same pattern goes for left side.
